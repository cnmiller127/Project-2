Project 2 Post Mortem

## Thigs we did well
    * Git hub (pushing and merging) process went a lot smoother than the on the first project
    * Communicating changes with each other during the process
    * Collaborating and helping each other if we struggled with the code

## Things we learned / want to improve
    * More planning and pseudocoding before we started coding to avoid too many last minute changes
    * Get more practice with Travis CLI and the linting process. Very time consuming during the review process, but helpful after getting hang of it
    * Adding more features such as edit and delete buttons
